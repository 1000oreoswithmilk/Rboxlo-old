# Overview

Rboxlo is a 100% open source, 100% transparent, not-for-profit Roblox private server. Our mission is to let users play Roblox without restrictions imposed by Roblox, while maintaining transparency. You can learn more about us and our goals [here](https://www.rboxlo.xyz/about/mission).

Some distinct features about Rboxlo:
 - Open source
 - Roblox years 2007 through 2017
 - The source code is dedicated to the public domain, with all waiver of copyright, meaning that anybody can do what they please with the Rboxlo framework.
 - All staff actions are [audited](https://www.rboxlo.xyz/audits/), as the lack of transparency is slowly becoming more and more of an issue within the old Roblox community

# Copyright

## License
In our `LICENSE` file, we define Rboxlo as software dedicated and released into the public domain, and we waive any copyright from the project's source files. Our license file is based off of the [Unlicense.](https://unlicense.org/)

## Roblox Copyrighted Content
No Roblox copyrighted works can be found on here (besides parodies of the official Roblox logo, past or present), meaning you cannot find any Roblox game executables here. On our official website, all Roblox executables hosted there are based off of files made available by Roblox Corporation to the general public, and were not obtained illegally. All contribution made here was not made with the motive of monetary gain; it was simply to make a better Roblox. Should Roblox send us a DMCA, or a Cease and Desist, we will remove the offending items in particular. If they say to take down the website, the website will be taken down. If we have to delete this repository, we shall take this repository down.

This project is for educational purposes only.

## Copyrighted Content Onsite
Rboxlo's infrastructure relies heavily on user content creation, and we understand that some times users may not fully understand copyright laws. That is why we ask that any person(s) finding copyrighted material onsite should submit an E-Mail to copyright@rboxlo.xyz containing a URL for the offending material in particular and we will remove it as soon as possible, with moderation taken on user.

If you know how to fix an issue, feel free to make a pull request for the issue.

We ask that all pull request authors add this paragraph to the end of their contribution's details so as to retain Rboxlo as 100% public domain software.

```
I dedicate any and all copyright interest in this software to the
public domain. I make this dedication for the benefit of the public at
large and to the detriment of my heirs and successors. I intend this

# Fair Use

Copyright Disclaimer under section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976, allowance is made for “fair use” for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education and research.

Fair use is a use permitted by copyright statute that might otherwise be infringing.

### Fair Use Definition

Fair use is a doctrine in United States copyright law that allows limited use of copyrighted material without requiring permission from the rights holders, such as commentary, criticism, news reporting, research, teaching or scholarship. It provides for the legal, non-licensed citation or incorporation of copyrighted material in another author’s work under a four-factor balancing test.
