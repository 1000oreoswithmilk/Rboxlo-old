# Overview

Rboxlo is a 100% open source, 100% transparent, not-for-profit Roblox private server. Our mission is to let users play Roblox without restrictions imposed by Roblox, while maintaining transparency. You can learn more about us and our goals [here](https://www.rboxlo.xyz/about/mission).

Some distinct features about Rboxlo:
 - Open source
 - Roblox years 2007 through 2017
 - Repository is under UNLICENSE, meaning that anybody can modify and re-distribute the code however they please
 - All staff actions are [audited](https://www.rboxlo.xyz/audits/), as the lack of transparency is slowly becoming more and more of an issue within the old Roblox community

# Contributing

Rboxlo was created with the mission of being as open source as possible, and we would like to uphold that mission by licensing Rboxlo under the Unlicense. The Unlicense allows anyone to modify and distribute the code as they please; so feel free to fork the project! There are no restrictions imposed on you if you do so.

If you find any problem(s) in Rboxlo, feel free to submit an issue. This includes stuff like vulnerabilities, or even the most trivial issues (such as typoes.)

If you know how to fix an issue, feel free to make a pull request for the issue.

If you would like to suggest a feature or change, submit it as an issue as well; it will be given the appropriate tag once we have seen it.

This repository is for educational purposes only.

# Regarding Roblox executables

Rboxlo is written in many different languages, such as JavaScript and PHP. We would like to make some things clear about this repository, however:
 - There are no Roblox proprietary works located here
 - There are no Roblox executables here, meaning that there are also no Rboxlo downloads here, nor are there RCCService downloads

We will only publish works that we ourselves have made on this repository.

# Fair Use

Copyright Disclaimer under section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976, allowance is made for “fair use” for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education and research.

Fair use is a use permitted by copyright statute that might otherwise be infringing.

### Fair Use Definition

Fair use is a doctrine in United States copyright law that allows limited use of copyrighted material without requiring permission from the rights holders, such as commentary, criticism, news reporting, research, teaching or scholarship. It provides for the legal, non-licensed citation or incorporation of copyrighted material in another author’s work under a four-factor balancing test.
