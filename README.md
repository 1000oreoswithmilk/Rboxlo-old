Rboxlo is a 99.9% open-source, not-for-profit, 100% transparent Roblox private server. Our aim is to let users play Roblox without restrictions imposed by Roblox, while maintaining transparency. You can read more about our mission here: https://rb.ozzt.pw/about/mission.

Pay us a visit at https://rb.ozzt.pw/!

Rboxlo is written in PHP, with the client-side work in JavaScript. This repository ONLY contains the server-side code (meaning, *just* the website.) There are no RCCService executables here. There is no Roblox source code here. There are no Roblox proprietary works located on this repository. We will only publish the work that we ourselves have made (excluding stuff like Roblox source diff-trees.)

We love open-source, and we want to show that by us licensing Rboxlo under the MIT license. Feel free to do anything you want with the code!

If you see a vulnerability, or some other issue that needs to be resolved, please do at least one of the three:
 - Raise a GitHub issue
 - Disclose it to me through the Rboxlo discord
 - E-Mail us (rboxlo6969@gmail.com)
